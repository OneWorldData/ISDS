France Telecom alleged that: (i) its BOT contract was prematurely terminated; (ii) it was the victim of expropriation; and (iii) it had failed to receive fair and equitable treatment at the hands of the Lebanese state. The French firm claimed some US$771 million in damages, including compensation for the remainder of the BOT contract. The Lebanese Government filed a counter-claim for $840 million in damages against France Telecom. Initially, France Telecom pursued arbitration both at the International Chamber of Commerce, and under the UNCITRAL rules, but ultimately pursued the claim solely under the UNCITRAL rules. In a recent decision of 22 February 2005, the arbitration panel rendered a US$266 million award against Lebanon.

The dispute centered on bankruptcy proceedings involving BCT, a privatised company acquired by the claimants that produced traditional yarn and thread. The claimants argued that the government had taken a benevolent approach to the company’s tax arrears, before unfairly abandoning its leniency when it pushed the company into bankruptcy proceedings. The claimants also alluded to a “financial mafia” eager to take hold of BCT’s real-estate, and which allegedly pressured Slovakian authorities and courts to act improperly.",,,

The dispute related to two gaming joint ventures that pre-dated the dissolution of Yugoslavia. The business relationship between Adria and the Croatian Lottery deteriorated when Adria tried to seize management control of the joint ventures from the Croatian Lottery. This resulted in management deadlock in the joint ventures and (along with other factors) led the Croatian Lottery to terminate the joint ventures in 1994. Following the termination, Adria commenced legal proceedings against the Croatian Lottery in the courts of the Republic of Croatia. The Croatian court ordered the Croatian Lottery to pay EUR4.5 million compensation to Adria, but Adria continued to pursue a separate claim against the Croatian Lottery for lost profits before the Croatian courts.
