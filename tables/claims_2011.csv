","Frankfurt airport’s Fraport invested more than $425 million in the construction of a new terminal at Manila’s Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Following construction of the terminal, Fraport alleges that the Philippines nullified the contracts and seized the terminal in violation of its investment treaty. In August 2007 a divided panel declined jurisdiction over the case on the grounds that Fraport had violated Philippine “antidummy” law, which prohibits Filipinos from letting foreigners manage a public utility. However, in December 2010 ICSID annulled the arbitral award, because the original tribunal had denied the parties opportunity to comment fully on the significance of a new authority that the respondent had submitted late in the arbitration—namely, a Philippine special prosecutor’s determination that there had been no violation of Philippine law, and part of the record on which it was based.

Veeder; Horacio Grigera Naon; Vaughan Lowe,V. V. Veeder,Horacio Grigera Naon,Vaughan Lowe,"An arbitration designed to protect Chevron from the epic environmental trial brought in Lago Agrio, Ecuador. In the underlying suit, residents of the Ecuadorian Amazon allege that Texaco Petroleum Company devastated the area through its oil operations in Ecuador from 1972 to 1992, as the minority owner of a consortium with PetroEcuador. This ad hoc arbitration, filed in September 2009, is being conducted under the UNCITRAL rules by arbitrators meeting in London under the supervision of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. Chevron’s statement of claim argued that Ecuador breached the 1998 settlement and release agreement it signed with Texaco by allowing the trial to proceed; and that the trial was violating the USA–Ecuador investment treaty, as well as international law, because it was rife with fraud and collusion. Ecuador thoroughly contests the claim. In March 2010 a USA district court in New York declined to stay this treaty arbitration, and in March 2011 the USA Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. The hearing on arbitral jurisdiction took place in November 2010. On February 9, 2011, the arbitrators granted interim measures, ordering Ecuador not to advance enforcement of any Ecuadorian court judgment against Chevron. The Ecuadorian court judgment came down five days later, in the amount of roughly $18 billion (including roughly $9 billion that kicked in after Chevron did not apologize within two weeks). The arbitration asks, among other things, for an order that Ecuador reimburse Chevron for any damages, and a declaration that Chevron is not liable for damages.","Focus Europe: Arbitration Scorecard (Treaties), July 1, 2011",TREATY
