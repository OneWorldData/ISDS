France Telecom’s subsidiary had been offering GSM mobile service pursuant to a Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) contract since 1994. France Telecom alleged that: (i) its BOT contract was prematurely terminated; (ii) it was the victim of expropriation; and (iii) it had failed to receive fair and equitable treatment at the hands of the Lebanese state. The French firm claimed some US$771 million in damages, including compensation for the remainder of the BOT contract. The Lebanese Government filed a counter-claim for $840 million in damages against France Telecom. Initially, France Telecom pursued arbitration both at the International Chamber of Commerce, and under the UNCITRAL rules, but ultimately pursued the claim solely under the UNCITRAL rules. In a recent decision of 22 February 2005, the arbitration panel rendered a US$266 million award against Lebanon. Lebanon has filed an application to the Swiss Federal Supreme Court to set aside the award. (http://www.ictregulationtoolkit.org/en/toolkit/notes/PracticeNote/2563)",http://www.italaw.com/cases/452

In 2006 Chevron filed an arbitration supervised by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. In March 2010 arbitrators ruled that chronic delays in the Ecuadorian courts breached the treaty's guarantee of an effective means of defense.

Veeder,Yes,Vaughn Lowe,Yes,Horatio Grigera Naon,Yes,"An arbitration designed to protect Chevron from the epic environmental trial in the Ecuadorian Amazon, where plaintiffs claimed up to $113 billion in damages and won a $19 billion judgment in February 2011, which they seek to enforce in Argentina, Brazil, and Canada. In the underlying suit, local residents alleged that Chevron's predecessor Texaco Inc. devastated the area through its oil operations in Ecuador from 1972 to 1992. Chevron has filed 23 actions for USA discovery in aid of arbitration, and a New York civil action against the plaintiffs team for racketeering, where it argued that the verdict was procured by fraud and corruption. Ecuador and the plaintiffs dispute Chevron’s allegations. In fall 2012, the arbitrators held a first-phase trial on the merits, to consider whether Ecuador breached a release agreement signed with Texaco in return for a limited cleanup by the oil company. At a second trial in January 2014, they are to consider whether Ecuador's courts deprived Chevron of the effective means of defense guaranteed by the USA-Ecuador investment treaty, or effected a denial of justice under international law. Meanwhile, the parties have clashed over interim measures. In February 2011, the tribunal ordered Ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend enforcement of the judgment. The Ecuadorian judgment arrived five days later. In February 2012, the tribunal asserted jurisdiction, while reiterating and particularizing its order to suspend enforcement. The Ecuadorian judgment was finalized five months later. In February 2013 the tribunal found that Ecuador had violated its interim measures and ordered Ecuador to explain why it should not compensate Chevron for any harm caused. Ecuador has asked the tribunal to reconsider its conclusion that Ecuador violated its interim orders. The parties are briefing both questions this summer. In principle, the arbitrators may, in their interim or final decision, order Ecuador to reimburse Chevron for its stratospheric attorneys’ fees, as well as for any damages collected by the plaintiffs.",http://www.italaw.com/cases/251

When IPB, nearing insolvency, was nudged into forced administration and subsequently sold off by the state, SalUnited Kingdoma cried foul and turned to arbitration.

Yves Fortier,unknownValue,Charles Poncet,Yes,Stephen Schwebel,Yes,"An historic trio of cases brought against Russia by the majority shareholders of the defunct Yukos Oil Company. Claimants argue that Russia drove Yukos into bankruptcy through allegedly inflated tax claims in a vendetta against former CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky. In its defense, Russia has argued that its courts properly adjudicated genuine tax offenses. Citing unfair treatment and expropriation in violation of the Energy Charter Treaty, claimants currently seek damages of $114 billion.  In November 2009 the tribunal asserted jurisdiction. The case was tried over five weeks in October and November 2012. The arbitrators’ decision is pending. In related cases involving token damages, minority shareholders of Yukos largely persuaded arbitrators of their story, while Yukos management obtained mixed results in the European Court of Human Rights.

In March 2009 the state began seizing and auctioning Perenco’s crude oil in order to pay accumulated assessments. In May 2009, the tribunal ordered Ecuador to refrain from pursuing any action to collect the disputed amounts -- but the state took the position that ICSID interim measures are non-binding, and continued.
