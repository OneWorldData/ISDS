# ISDS cases 1987 - 2014

This easy python script merges the various tables we have used to create our own table of all Investor State Dispute Settlements from 1987 to 2014. With thanks to :

- The American Lawyer magazine's Arbitration Scorecard
- Gus van Hartenn at IIAPP
- Enric Garcia Torrents
- UNCTAD
- IAReporter
- citizen.org
- Frank Mulder for lots of manual work

Description of the cases was taken over from different sources. We therefore accept no liability for any inaccuracies or omissions in the tables. Please let us know if you come across any irregularities in the data.
