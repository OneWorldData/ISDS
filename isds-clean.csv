South Africa denies that it will settle the claim, insisting that its action do not violate international law. However, the government might consent to a move by the investors to withdraw the claim.

VEEDER,yes,Vaughan LOWE,yes,Horatio Grigera Naon,yes,"An arbitration designed to protect Chevron from the epic environmental trial in the Ecuadorian Amazon, where plaintiffs claimed up to $113 billion in damages and won a $19 billion judgment in February 2011, which they seek to enforce in Argentina, Brazil, and Canada. In the underlying suit, local residents alleged that Chevron's predecessor Texaco Inc. devastated the area through its oil operations in Ecuador from 1972 to 1992. Chevron has filed 23 actions for USA discovery in aid of arbitration, and a New York civil action against the plaintiffs team for racketeering, where it argued that the verdict was procured by fraud and corruption. Ecuador and the plaintiffs dispute Chevron’s allegations. In fall 2012, the arbitrators held a first-phase trial on the merits, to consider whether Ecuador breached a release agreement signed with Texaco in return for a limited cleanup by the oil company. At a second trial in January 2014, they are to consider whether Ecuador's courts deprived Chevron of the effective means of defense guaranteed by the USA-Ecuador investment treaty, or effected a denial of justice under international law. Meanwhile, the parties have clashed over interim measures. In February 2011, the tribunal ordered Ecuador to take all measures at its disposal to suspend enforcement of the judgment. The Ecuadorian judgment arrived five days later. In February 2012, the tribunal asserted jurisdiction, while reiterating and particularizing its order to suspend enforcement. The Ecuadorian judgment was finalized five months later. In February 2013 the tribunal found that Ecuador had violated its interim measures and ordered Ecuador to explain why it should not compensate Chevron for any harm caused. Ecuador has asked the tribunal to reconsider its conclusion that Ecuador violated its interim orders. The parties are briefing both questions this summer. In principle, the arbitrators may, in their interim or final decision, order Ecuador to reimburse Chevron for its stratospheric attorneys’ fees, as well as for any damages collected by the plaintiffs.",http://www.italaw.com/cases/251

In 2006 Chevron filed an arbitration supervised by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. In March 2010 arbitrators ruled that chronic delays in the Ecuadorian courts breached the treaty's guarantee of an effective means of defense. The tribunal found that the damage amounted to $698.6 million, but in August 2011 -- after accounting for taxes -- it awarded net damages of only $96.3 million.

The French firm claimed some US$771 million in damages, including compensation for the remainder of the BOT contract.
